    <p>Israeli Prime Minister <b> <a href="https://twitter.com/israelipm?lang=en">Israeli Prime Minister </a>Benjamin Netanyahu </b>rejected what he said were conditions proposed by Hamas for the release of the remaining <i>hostages </i> held in <b> Gaza </b>, including the <b> end</b> of the war and the withdrawal of <i>Israeli</i> forces from the Strip.   <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/20/palestinians-accuse-israeli-forces-of-executing-19-civilians-in-gaza">Israeli forces</a> appeared to <i>ramp</i> up ground and aerial <b>attacks </b> overnight <i>around</i> the southern Gazan <i>city</i> of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/12/what-is-khan-younis-gaza-israel-palestine/">Khan Younis</a>, according to local media and eyewitnesses, after Israel’s defense <b>minister </b> said operations there were “in full swing.”</p>

    <p>Even before Oct. 7, this <i>year</i> (2023) was one of the most <b>violent</b>   <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/hamass-october-7-attack-visualizing-data">violent years </a> in <b>Palestine</b> in more than a decade. At least 247 Palestinians—including 47 <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/22/israel/gaza-hostilities-take-horrific-toll-children">children</a>—had been killed by Israeli soldiers and <i>settlers</i> before the end of <b>September</b>. During the same <i>period</i>, Israeli settlers <i>launched</i> over 800  <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israeli-settler-attacks-on-west-bank-palestinians-have-escalated-since-oct-7-un-says">attacks</a>on Palestinians and Palestinian-owned property. <i>Additionally</i>, over 1,100 <b>Palestinians</b> had been <b>forcibly</b> displaced <i>from</i> their homes. </p>
